Hire me to empower and upskill your engineering team

## About me

We may have met at one of the conferences where I have spoken or attended (Symfony Live, SymfonyCon, API Platform Con, Afup Day, API Days, local meetups).

In terms of technical skills, my deepest areas of expertise include product engineering in PHP/OOP, clean code, proper use of design patterns, SOLID principles, the Law of Demeter, and a solid understanding of architectural variations around DDD (hexagonal, onion, and clean architecture).

I also consider myself to have a strong knowledge of GIT, GitLab, Symfony, API Platform, RESTful API design (I have written a book on this topic; you can find my knowledge tree here: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMW-gn64=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMW-gn64=/){:target="_blank"}), API governance, and API-centric software design, open-source software, algorithms and data structures, programming language fundamentals, Kubernetes and containerization, security, and privacy protection.

I have been a member of the [AFUP Haut De France](https://afup.org/home){:target="_blank"} office (The french association of PHP Users) for several years, and I contribute to organizing local meetups (connecting people and topics for discussions, as well as businesses wishing to host the event, with 2 to 3 speakers and between 40 and 80 participants), as well as AFUP Day (which brings together 8 to 10 speakers and between 100 and 200 participants, depending on the edition).

## Roles as Architect / Auditor

Thanks to the multitude of situations encountered during training sessions and consulting missions, I have assimilated a large number of concrete cases, both good and bad practices, tools, software and system architectures, and management methods...
Here is a non-exhaustive list of clients with whom I have worked to audit or design applications*: Fédération Française de Ski, Fédération Française de Natation, Ozzak, INSA, ASN, Conforama Suisse, Viously, Eat Machine, Orientoi, Roularta.be, Vestiaire Collective, Hakisa...

## Roles as Consultant

Recently, I assisted in migrating a pure player (Sweeek) from bare-metal to Kubernetes, and I provided consulting as an architect for the Fédération Française de Ski, the Fédération Française de Natation and Fédération Française de Vélo. Although I cannot disclose some projects, If I were to list my most allowed representative interventions, they would be as follows:

- **Nuclear Safety Authority** - Architect for the redesign of the filing and tracking tools for declarations. This tool allows managers of nuclear activities, those in the field of proximity nuclear activities, and operators of Basic Nuclear Installations to carry out their administrative procedures in a dematerialized manner. My role was to ensure the system's flexibility while guaranteeing maximum information security.
- **Sweeek** - Lead Developer for a pure player for the migration of Symfony and API Platform versions. I participated in the implementation of a multi-region Kubernetes setup on AWS by writing Dockerfiles and Helm charts, with the goal of cost reduction and high availability.
- **SINDUP** - Auditor for the valuation of software as part of a transformation into a SCIC, at the request of the Regional Union of SCOPs.
French Swimming Federation  - Architect and trainer for the design of the licensed space using Symfony and API Platform. The application features a PWA and mobile notification functionalities.
- **Fédération Française de ski** - Architect and consultant for the design of the licensed space using Symfony and API Platform. The application includes a PWA and mobile notification features.
- **Relais & Châteaux** - Lead Developer for the editorial and e-commerce site during the migration from Prestashop to Sylius.
Super Impression - Architect and Lead Developer for an e-commerce site with a tool for designing advertising panels from the web interface.
- **Orientoi** - Consultant for an audit, a major version migration, coaching in Symfony and API Platform, and involvement in the implementation of SSO authentication.
- **Creation of training programs.**
- **Open Source contributions** with Symfony, API Platform, and Docusign
- **R&D** for a Web RFC for batch processing

## Open Source

For several years, I have been involved in Open Source development. I was once the maintainer of a library to facilitate the integration of Docusign into Symfony. I had the opportunity to contribute to Symfony and API Platform, as well as participate in design meetings with the core team and assist in the design of the demo. I am fortunate to be quite close to the individuals responsible for maintaining these frameworks; they provide me with tremendous support on a daily basis.
I have had the opportunity multiple times to invest more in the projects and eventually to become an official member of the core team, but this goal has never really attracted me.

## What tasks can you assign to me?

As mentioned above, I hold a senior/director-level position and am open to management roles, but in my ideal role, my day consists of:
- Collaborating on product strategy and governance.
- Assisting in the selection of system and software architecture, as well as APIs.
- Pair programming to unblock both junior and experienced engineers.
- Supporting individuals in delicate interpersonal situations.
- Noticing something broken in a feature I’ve never worked on and fixing it instead of just filling out a ticket.
- Debugging a sensitive production incident calmly and clearly.
- Helping engineers and non-engineers resolve whatever is blocking them.
- Teaching colleagues a thoughtful perspective on code (or documentation).
- Training colleagues.
- Programming sophisticated features.
- Although the role of "the person who can step in everywhere to fix things and help people" is not a common position, if you have a need for this role, I can certainly fulfill it. Finally, I tend to dive passionately into any area and take my topics to heart, including:
- Automation wherever possible.
- Avoiding scheduling a meeting with ten colleagues.
- Ensuring that the chosen tools are justified, not necessarily just an Excel sheet or a PaaS/SaaS at €19.99 per person.
- Optimally leveraging the database for product engineers (schema changes are a nightmare... double writes, double reads, migration scripts, etc.).
- Industry-level collaboration and research within a recognized community.
