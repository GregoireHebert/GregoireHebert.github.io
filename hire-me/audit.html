    <p>
        With ten years of experience, I am a consultant at Les-Tilleuls.coop.<br/>
        I am a contributor to numerous Open Source projects and technical articles editor, I am also the manager of Masterclass, the professional training organization of the cooperative.<br/>
        "Always love what you do because you won't always do what you love. That's pretty much my personal approach of coding :) It helps me never come back on a piece of code and regret not having taken more time."<br/>
        <br/>
        I am specialized into PHP development, and I work with Symfony and API Platform daily.<br/>
        I can audit the code quality and security of your project.<br/>
        Usually the minimum mission is composed of 5 days including report writing.<br/>
        From that report you can initiate the changes suggested. I can also accompany you for this.
