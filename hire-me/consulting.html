        "Always love what you do because you won't always do what you love. That's pretty much my personal approach of coding :) It helps me never come back on a piece of code and regret not having taken more time."<br/>
        <br/>
        I am specialized into PHP development, and I work with Symfony and API Platform daily.<br/>
        I can accompany your team in the position of team leader, technical director and software architecture.
